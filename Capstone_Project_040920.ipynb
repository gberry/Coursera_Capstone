    "As the Covid 19 pandemic sweeps across the United States many states, counties and cities have implemented \"social distancing\" laws relating to a restriction on the number and distance at which citizens can congregate. New York City (NYC) has  facilitated enforcement of their local distancing ordinance by allowing citizens to report suspected violations by phone, and on-line using a \"311\" service, which is analogous to the \"911\" emergency response system but for lower urgency issues. The NYC Police Department (PD) assigns each report to one or more officers for review, and investigation at the location of the complaint. Many of these reports turn out to be non-actionable (i.e. the investigation does not result in a successful resoluton of the issue or issuance of a violation to suspects.)"

    "A. Detect and define distinct clusters within the reports that might indicate locations that could be included in more routined PD patrols to deter social distancing violators and thus reduce the necessity of citizen reports and one-off dispatches of officers to handle those calls.\n",

The leaders of the communities (e.g. community boards) where social distancing reports were made would also likely be interested in understanding how their community compared to others in terms of social distancing related incidents."
